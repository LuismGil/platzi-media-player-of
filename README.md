# platzi-media-player

This project was developed for educational purposes, in order to largely implement the functionality of Vue in [professional JavaScript course](https://platzi.com/clases/javascript-profesional/)

Consists of a SPA (single page application) of a common media player, where we implement some APIS that offers us the DOM, so we can manipulate the functionality of the player automatically from the code.
